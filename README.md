# Alan Xiong and Andrew Zhong's ECON 1500 Final Project

This final project is a interactive dashboard visualizing international trade from 1988-2021, in order to provide insights into the following questions: 

What goods have been traded by countries since WWII?

How has trade impacted national economies, how have impacts trended over time and differed amongst countries?

Who are the countries or industries that have been the most helped, or hurt, by trade?

Why do countries trade more with some countries than others (determinants of trade)?

# Changes in the Final Project from the Proposal, with reasoning:

Modifications to Project Goals:

Data is for 1988-2021 rather than starting from end of WW2, as WITS downloadable data for most countries begins then, and could not find other publicly available data

Modifications to Size/Scope:

Instead of 1 interactive component (slicer) shared throughout all pages of the report, we added specialized interactive components to each page for ease for use

Modifications to Sketch/Prototype of Project:

Page 1: Did not visualize value-added trade, number of trade agreements, or FDI due to lack of data. Page 1 instead focuses on export/import volume by country and industry

Page 2: Opted to show regression lines between trade measures and economic indicators, but did not show a ranking with most extreme regression estimates due to timeliness concerns of running regressions for 175 countries

Page 3: Opted to show heatmap with gravity model variables instead of regression relationship between each other for better visualization
